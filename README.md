# Application voyage Angular/Node.js/PostgreSQL

This project was carried out during the training of Application Designer Developer at Digifab, while learning Angular.

## **Technologies used**

Language : Angular14

IDE : Visual Studio Code

Design : Figma

## Objective

This project is the last realized during my training (outside internship). The goal is to create a complete application (database, backend, and frontend) **to verify that all the skills related to the diploma of designer developer of applications are validated**. Everyone writes their code but group reflection is encouraged **to develop teamwork, communication, and mutual aid.**

## Points pour le diplôme, validés avec cette application :

- Modeling an application: Realization of the model of the application on Figma.
- Develop a desktop type user interface: The application was developed on Electron.
- Develop data access components: The “pg” (node-postgre) library was used as a backend to retrieve data from the database.
- Develop the frontend part of a web user interface: The frontend was made with Angular 15.
- Develop the backend part of a web user interface: The backend was made with Node.js and Express.js.

---

- Design a database: The realization of the entity-relationship diagram was made with PowerDesigner.
- Set up a database: The database is relational. It is made with PostgreSQL and tested on pgAdmin. Its access is secured by a password.
- Develop components in the language of a database: The database has been tested on Postman, in particular with triggers.

---

- Collaborate in the management of an IT project and the organization of the development environment: In order to work as a team, we used the Agile Scrum method and we managed our tasks on Notion.
- Designing an application: Specifications were produced as a group.
- Develop business components: I used the Angular framework with components, services, models, modals, controllers, guards, …
- Build an application organized in layers: I created the database, the backend and the front end, while ensuring the proper articulation of these layers between them.
- Develop a mobile application: I developed this application with Capacitor on Android Studio.
- Prepare and execute test plans for an application: I ensured the proper functioning of the application by performing tests throughout its development. I also used Postman to test the backend routes.
- Prepare and execute the deployment of an application: I deployed the application on Render (web host)

### Implementation steps

---

1. Process of reflection on the theme
2. Implementation of group work methods
3. Establishment of specifications
4. Realization of the model with Figma
5. Database mapping.
6. Database creation + code generation.
7. Development of the backend by ensuring communication with the database + security of data access.
8. Building routes in the backend + testing with Postman
9. Creation of the Front-end with the different components and services.
10. Securing access to the application (account protected by an encrypted password and a token) + controllers and guards.
11. Deployment of the application on render then Electron and Capacitor.

Throughout the project, technology watches were shared within the team.
